# AR Awareness Game for Children

## Overview
The **AR Awareness Game** is an interactive augmented reality educational game designed to teach children about safety and awareness in real-life scenarios. Using **Vuforia** and **Unity**, the game provides an engaging learning experience where children can interact with AR scenarios using a physical book containing image targets.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality Interaction** – Uses Vuforia image targets to display 3D environments and interactive safety scenarios.
- **Multiple Safety Scenarios**:
  - **Fire Safety** – Educates children on staying calm, evacuating safely, and calling emergency services.
  - **Thunderstorm Safety** – Teaches children safe actions during a thunderstorm, including avoiding trees and seeking shelter.
  - **Road Crossing Awareness** – Helps children learn how to cross the road safely using a zebra crossing and traffic signals.
- **Decision-Based Learning** – Children make choices, and the game provides feedback on whether their actions were safe or unsafe.
- **Dynamic Visual & Audio Feedback**:
  - Animated 3D characters demonstrating correct and incorrect choices.
  - Voiceovers using **Resemble AI** to guide and instruct children.
  - Sound effects for reinforcement (car honks, safety alerts, etc.).
- **No Physics-Based Interactions** – All interactions and movements are scripted without Rigidbody or Colliders.
- **Compulsory Physical Book** – The game requires a physical book containing all the image targets necessary for the AR experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity** (Game Engine)
